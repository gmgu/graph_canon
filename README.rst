GraphCanon
##########

GraphCanon is a C++ library with an algorithm framework for graph canonicalization,
graph isomorphism, and computation of automorphism groups of graphs.
The package additionally contains a program ``graph-canon``,
which makes many variations of the core algorithm available from the command line.
The program also facilitates extraction of additional data from the algorithm run,
e.g., visualization data for the `GraphCanon Visualizer <https://github.com/jakobandersen/graph_canon_vis>`__.

The library was initially written as part of the paper
**A Generic Framework for Engineering Graph Canonization Algorithms**
[`DOI <http://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611975055.13>`__ | `TR <http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08289>`__].

See `here <https://jakobandersen.github.io/graph_canon>`__ for the documentation,
and `here <https://jakobandersen.github.io/graph_canon/installation>`__ for installation instructions.
If you install from the repository sources, remember to run ``./bootstrap.sh`` first.
