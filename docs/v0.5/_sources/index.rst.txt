Introduction
============

This is the documentation for the GraphCanon library and its associated executables.
The library provides an algorithm framework for graph canonicalization,
graph isomorphism, and computation of automorphism groups of graphs,
using a customizable individualization-refinement algorithm.

The library was initially written as part of the paper
**A Generic Framework for Engineering Graph Canonization Algorithms**
[`DOI <http://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611975055.13>`__ | `TR <http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08289>`__].

The library can for example be used for

- finding a canonical order of the vertices of a given graph,
- finding the automorphism group of a given graph,
- using a canonical vertex order to create a view of a graph with canonical iteration order,
- lexicographical comparison of such permuted graph views, e.g., for isomorphism testing.

Graphs with vertices labelled with elements from a totally ordered set
are handled by a user-supplied less-predicate (as you would provide to `std::sort`).
The library also supports graphs where edges are similarly labelled,
though for obtaining efficient implementations this may require substantial work from the user.

Handling of permutation groups is done using the `PermGroup <https://github.com/jakobandersen/perm_group>`__ library which is currently under heavy development.

The package additionally contains a program ``graph-canon``,
which makes many variations of the core algorithm available from the command line.
The program also facilitates extraction of additional data from the algorithm run,
e.g., visualization data for the `GraphCanon Visualizer <https://github.com/jakobandersen/graph_canon_vis>`__.
