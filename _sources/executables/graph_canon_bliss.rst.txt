.. program:: graph-canon-bliss

The ``graph-canon-bliss`` wrapper script is simply a facade for an installed
`Bliss <http://www.tcs.hut.fi/Software/bliss/program>`__ instance,
to provide a common interface with :program:`graph-canon`.

Each Bliss invocation is on the form ``bliss -can -v=1 <file>``.

.. option:: -h

 Show the help message for the wrapper script, and for Bliss, and then exit.

.. option:: -f <file>

 The input file, which should be in the format Bliss accepts (DIMACS).

.. option:: --id <string>

 A string to prepend to status lines.
 The output of Bliss is printed by the wrapper script, but is also parsed
 and when the tree node count and total time has been printed, an extra
 status line is printed with the given string prepended.
 This should provide a common tabulation scheme of results from different programs.

.. option:: -p <int>, --permutations <int>

 The number of repetition of the Bliss invocation to perform (default: 100).
 Note that each invocation is the same, and thus no randomization is performed.

.. option:: --memcheck
            --vgArgs <arg>
            --debug

 Ignored options, present for compatibility with other programs.
